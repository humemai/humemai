# Graph Learning

## [`process-raw-data`](./process-raw-data.ipynb)

- This jupyter notebook processes the raw data (saved at
  [`./user-raw-data/new`](./user-raw-data/new)) that Emma gave me.
- It processes them and saves `raw-data.json`.
- The raw data is converted into rdf-data, and is saved at [`./rdf-data`](./rdf-data)
- I also visualize the graph, which is saved at [`./graphs-visualized`](./graphs-visualized/)

## [`graph-learning.ipynb`](./graph-learning.ipynb)

This makes them into RDF-turtle files and saves them at [`user-raw-data`](./user-raw-data). There are in total of 192 CPs (graphs) saved. Also take a look at [`ontology.ttl`](./ontology.ttl).
