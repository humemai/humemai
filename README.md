This repo hosts a package `humemai`, a human-like memory system, modeled with knowledge
knoweldge graphs (KGs).

## Installation

The `humemai` python package can already be found in [the PyPI server](https://pypi.org/project/humemai/)

```sh
pip install humemai
```

Supports python>=3.10

## RDF-based or JanusGraph-Cassandra-based HumemAI

### RDF-based: [`./humemai/rdflib`](./humemai/rdflib)

I stopped working on this. It's very likely that I'll transition to a property graph
based method, e.g., JanusGraph-Cassandra

### JanusGraph-Cassandra-based: [`./humemai/janusgraph`](./humemai/janusgraph)

WIP!!

## Updates

### 24-Oct-2024

- Finished implementing RDFLib-based HumemAI
  - [`humemai/rdflib/memory.py`](./humemai/rdflib/memory.py)
- Made a very sipmle example
  - [`examples/example-rdflib-agent.ipynb`](./examples/example-rdflib-agent.ipynb)
- Released v2

### 11-Aug-2024

- Used RL to learn policies, e.g., memory management, maze navigation, question answering.
- The HumemAI memories are nothing but python objects, i.e., list of quadruples
- Released v1.1.2

## TODOs

- Implement JanusGraph + Cassandra DB
  - RDF-based graph as pros and cons. Let's try out a property graph.
- Implement a very simple text2graph and graph2text based on [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag)
- Implement a sipmle image2text2graph, e.g., face recognition.
